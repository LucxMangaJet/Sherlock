A:Dear Mister Holmes,
As a member of the Musicians' Union London i would like to invite you to a concert. I haven't seen you at any event in the recent past. 
This Friday at 4pm one of my most talented disciples Clarice Williams gives a concert at the Hippodrome of London. 
She is a really talented pianist and will surely be able to impress you. 
Attached to this letter you will find a ticket. 
Respectfully <NameRichard>Richard> Clarke. 
Head of the F.F.Chopin <NameSchool>Music> School;
