Q:What happened here?;
A:Richard... my beloved Richard... I found him at 6 pm as i was looking for him since I had not heard of him for a while... And he was just laying there... Dead... With all that blood... Usually his schedule is to play until  5 in the evening and then come downstairs, so when i heard him stop playing at 5 i was expecting him... I walked upstairs to check on him, i was worried, thought he might have one of his low days, but... when i walked in... Please don't let me talk about this... He is in the room up the stairs.;

Q:When was the last time you saw your Richard?;
A:Hmm, let me think ... Oh right i saw him before he started practicing. He went upstairs and closed his door behind him. Must have been nearly 2pm;

Q:Where were you between 2pm and 4pm?;
A:I was drinking tea with Theodore. <Cake>You know we made some some cake together as a suprise for the students and Richard>. He looked really happy after doing this. I guess he needed a break from all the playing.;
}
{1
Q:What can you tell me about the victim?;
A:He is... He was... a great man. He had no enemies! And he barely left the house! The Piano was all his life... all he cared about were his compositions! I can't think of anybody who could possibly do this to him.;
}
{1
Q:Did you notice anything suspicious?;
A:We had hard times recently... but besides that it was a normal day. He practiced most of the afternoon. <TimeTable>Everything was just like he planned it on his time table>.;

R:KnowClarice;
Q:What do you think about Clarice?;
A:She is such a sweet girl... Richard sort of adopted her after the war... He was like a father to her. I must admit, sometimes i am a little jealous about them.;

R:KnowTheodore;
Q:What do you think about Theodore?;
A:A cute boy, i know that he's already 19 but in some way, i feel like he's my little boy. He tries so hard to reach his sisters level.. Sadly i don't think that it's going to happen..;
}

R:KnowRobert;
Q:What do you think about Robert?;
A:Honestly I dont like him. He has no aspirations, and just spends his time distracting the other students, but what can we do? The family pays good money to have him study here.. <RichardDislikesRobertTakingNaps>Richard hated it when he procrastinated practice, and instead used the time to sleep in the lounge>.;

Q:BloodShoesShape;
A:Jesus! is this his blood? Why would you show that to me?;
}

{#
Q:PianoAutoPlayingMechanism;
A:Why would he have that? Does that mean that he wasn't practicing today?;

Q:MissingBayonett;
A:<War>Thats one of his trophyies from the war>. <MissingBayonettText> Something seems to be missing there>!;
}

{#
Q:BloodyBayonett;
A:I can't look at that, so bloody.;
}

{#
Q:RedWritingOnGreenList;
A:Thats strange... he wrote the last line in red color... impossible,  As a perfectionist he would never do this.<LovesGreen> He only used green>!;
}

{#
Q:MulticoloredCompositions;
A:Yeah he started doing that after the <War>war>.  Nobody knows what brought him to this weird behaviour..;
}


{@
Q:MissingBayonettText;
A:One of the blades seems to be missing... <War>I was so relieved when he came back from that bloody war>.;
}

{@
Q:SiblingsColorblind;
A:Thats true... It's not a big deal. <LovesGreen>Sometimes they have a hard time understanding the discussions about Richards obsession with green>.;
}

{@
Q:PreparedConcert;
A:Oh, yeah she prepared the concert. She looked a bit angry and was nervous. She also asked me which songs she should play..;
}

{@
Q:Cake;
A:The cake was supposed to be a surprise for Clarices concert..;
}
{@
Q:NapRobert;
A:Yes, he said that he wanted to take a nap, but i didn't really see him.;
}
{@
Q:RepeatingSong;
A:Now that i think about it you could be right. He really repeated one song the whole time. Thats quite unusual for him. He has such a wide repartoire and he usually practices large variaty of pieces..;

}

{@
Q:RedNotes;
A:<War>Yes thats normal since he came back from the war>;
}

{@
Q:LovesGreen;
A:Yes he really loves green, that is kind of sweet don't you think?  <War>After the war it got kind of out of hands, he would only use green>. And then suddenly he started using red in his compositions. I like to belive that it helped him face the terrors of those years..;
}

{@
Q:TimeTable;
A:<War>Hmm yeah, he does that since war>... It's hanging in his office, he plans everything there.;
}

{@
Q:War;
A:Before the war he was so kind... Don't get me wrong, deep inside him he's still the same man. When Clarice was younger she really was able to get that glance in his eyes back, only by playing piano. He was sitting in the main hall with her, just sitting on the ground listening to her playing. <Ticks>But now most of the time was spent on dealing with his weird habits>.;
}

{@
Q:RichardDislikesRobertTakingNaps;
A:Richard was really strict with Robert sometimes..;
}

{@
Q:Ticks;
A:He's trying to not let anything get close to him. These quirks are his way to fell safe. <War>Oh Good.. the war changed him so much>. I'ts really hard for me sometimes to see how he suffered from the stuff he experienced.;
}

{@
Q:RigorMortis;
A:I don't understand. I heard him playing just a few minutes before I opened the door. ..I'm sure it was his piano I heard.;
}

{@
Q:StabWounds;
A:Oh... I saw the stab wounds when i found him, but i can't imagine there being so many... Who would do something like this?;
}

{@
Q:ConfessionWhy;
A:Oh my Good... A part of me most likely knew that already... You know that explains a lot. Poor Richard, why didn't he tell me?;
}

{@
Q:SiblingsWroteOnList;
A:My only Question now is, why would they do that?;
}

{@
Q:FemaleMurderer;
A:Another Woman could that be? <Ticks>No not my Richard, sure he was acting strange sometimes and had his obsessions>... But it's impossible that he had another woman... I'm sorry that really confuses me.;
