A:Please dont think bad now about Richard. He was such a great pianist... <War>You can't understand what a great man he used to be before the war>... When I wrote my first piece totally on my own, he was so exited about it.. Due to a misunderstanding a director thaugh it was written by him... Richard was so enthusiastic when the compliments started coming in. After so many years of failures he finally was accepted again as a great componist.. At first i was happy, It was the least I could do to repay him for beeing my teacher and mentor for years. But then he kept becoming more self-focused and demanding. <ConfessionWhy>Those are my pieces>! <ConfessionWhy>He had no right in stealing my work>!;
