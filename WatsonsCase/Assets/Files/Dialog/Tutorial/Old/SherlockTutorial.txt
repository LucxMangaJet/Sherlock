Q:So, do you plan on going?;
A:Hmm... You know Watson, i'd rather solve an interesting case than waste my time discussing the old times at a party.
But i know that you enjoy these sort of events, so i'll give you a challange. If you can find out the real name of my old friend
we'll go together. It is the writer of one of those 3 letters on the table. Makes sure to bring some evidence too, random guesses are not tollerated.;
