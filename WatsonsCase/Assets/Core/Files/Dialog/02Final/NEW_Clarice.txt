Q:When was the last time you saw Richard?;

{1
Q:What can you tell me about the victim?;
A:He was more than a teacher to me, he was like a father . You need to know that my real father died during the war. Richard took me under his wings and cared for me as if I was one of his works. I owe him a lot. ;

R:TalkedSiblingsColorblind,TalkedRedWritingGreenList;
Q:You and Clarice are colorblind which could explain the red writing on the green timetable..;

R:TalkedSiblingsColorblind,TalkedMulticoloredCompositions;
Q:Richard only used red in his compositions, and you are colorblind, did you have something to do with that? ;
A:Please don't think bad now about Richard. He was such a great pianist... <War>You can't understand what a great man he used to be before the war>... When I wrote my first piece totally on my own, he was so excited about it.. Due to a misunderstanding a director though it was written by him... Richard was so enthusiastic when the compliments started coming in. After so many years of failures he finally was accepted again as a great composer.. At first I was happy, it was the least I could do to repay him for being my teacher and mentor for years. But then he kept becoming more self-focused and demanding. <ConfessionWhy>Those are my pieces>! <ConfessionWhy>He had no right in stealing my work>!;
