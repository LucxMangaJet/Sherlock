----Guidelines:-------
The "main" scene of the game can be find under /Assets/Scenes/2_levelLayout2
The Scripts are located at /Assets/Scripts/

The Core Scripts of the game are added as Components to the "GameHandle" Class which is parented to the 
"GameNecessities" GameObject 

While the "GameState" script is a good starting point it does not play the role of a general game-managing script, since all the features are implemented
in the respective scripts
